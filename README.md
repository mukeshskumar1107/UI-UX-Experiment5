## **Aim**

To analyze user pain points, write UX problem statements, choose suitable UX research methods, and create user personas for two different application scenarios using one real website per scenario.

---

## **Algorithm**

1. Select two UX scenarios.
2. Choose one real website for each scenario.
3. Observe the UI/UX and identify user pain points.
4. Write UX problem statements using the format:
   **"[User] needs a way to [achieve goal] because [obstacle], which results in [impact]."**
5. Select appropriate UX research methods and justify choices.
6. Create personas with demographics, goals, behaviors, pain points, and motivations.
7. Add screenshots for each website.
8. Document all findings and prepare README & PDF.
